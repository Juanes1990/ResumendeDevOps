I am Mechatronic Engineer with a great enthusiasm for learning new technologies to grow and help others. I am creative and disciplined; I have skills to work in a collaborative team and 
under pressure. I am passionate about programming and innovation, as well as looking for new challenges to face. I have a good knowledge of Python and MATLAB, and basics of HTML, CSS, 
C++ and Bash. My greatest motivation is to know how things work, how they are built and in general, how the world around me works. I am currently venturing into the testing field in a 
local company as a quality analyst.

Mechatronics engineering has allowed me some answers to these questions, however I am aware that I can still learn much more, while contributing to the knowledge and advances in the 
technological and energetic field.
